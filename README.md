# Employee Tracker

## Description
For a buisness that needs to keep track of its employees through a sql database. This program allows the user to browse through various menus that can show the buisness'<br>
roles, and employees. It also allows the user to add departments, roles and employees as well as remove employees from the database. I learned how to use javascript
to connect to sql and do commands that alter the tables in the database.
